# 🚨 Fraud Detection System

A machine learning system designed to detect fraudulent transactions in financial or e-commerce datasets. The goal is to help prevent fraud in real-time and reduce financial risk.

---

## 📌 Objective

Develop and evaluate a fraud detection model that:
- Accurately classifies transactions as **fraudulent** or **genuine**.
- Handles class imbalance effectively.
- Supports real-time or batch detection use cases.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Name:** Example: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Description:** Contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. Features are PCA-transformed due to confidentiality; the dataset is highly imbalanced.

## ⚙️ Techniques & Approach

✅ **Data Preprocessing**
- Handling missing values (if any)
- Feature scaling (e.g., StandardScaler)
- Balancing data using SMOTE or undersampling

✅ **Modeling**
- Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks
- Focus on high recall (catching frauds is more important than false positives)

✅ **Evaluation Metrics**
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- AUC-ROC
- Confusion matrix

✅ **Advanced Options**
- Real-time streaming with Kafka/Spark (optional)
- Anomaly detection techniques (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
